**🔍 I’m a postdoc at UCLA’s [Zhou Lab](https://zhoulab.org/), using deep learning to decode molecular structure.**

**📚 I hold a BSc in [Physics](https://english.phy.pku.edu.cn/), a PhD in [Meteorology](http://english.iap.cas.cn/), and have spent three years in postdoctoral research in [Structural Biology](https://cnsi.ucla.edu/).**

**🧠 My interests: discovering hidden patterns across scientific systems, and optimizing complex strategies.**
  - 🧩 I build interpretable models to reveal structure in proteins, weather, and markets—bridging physics, biology, and data.
  - ⚙️ I design efficiency: streamlining workflows, crafting investment logic, and engineering decision systems in Texas Hold’em.

# Selected Experience
## 🧑🏻‍🔬 Research Experience

Currently, I am a **Postdoctoral Researcher** at UCLA’s Zhou Lab, where I *design deep learning frameworks for protein and RNA identification in cryoEM maps*. My work focuses on multi‑hierarchical U‑Nets and scalable inference pipelines with automated preprocessing, driving end‑to‑end structure reconstruction from cryoEM density to atomic models.

As the **Lead Developer** of [CryoDataBot](https://github.com/t00shadow/CryoDataBot), I *built a full-stack pipeline for cryoEM dataset generation and annotation*. The resulting datasets improved model precision by over 22%.

Previously, as a **Doctoral Researcher** at the Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, I *investigated the impact of stratospheric sudden warming (SSW) on weather systems using machine learning*. I proposed a spatiotemporal PCA method for post‑event weather prediction, leveraging multivariate climate datasets. 


## 📝 Publication Experience

I lead independent research from concept to publication, with *first-author papers* in high-impact journals—including [the CryoDataBot study](https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/advance-article/doi/10.1093/gigascience/giaf127/8297133?searchresult=1) and [a paper on SSW‑related weather prediction](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021GL095431).  
My work spans deep learning, structural biology, and climate modeling—each project driven by pattern discovery and a robust model design. For a full list of my publications, please see my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HnhsYXgAAAAJ&hl=en).


## 👨🏻‍🏫 Teaching Experience
I mentor senior bioengineering students at UCLA, helping them turn deep learning ideas into real research. From cryoEM pipelines to backbone-tracing algorithms, I guide teams through proposals, models, and manuscripts—sometimes all in one quarter. If it lands on bioRxiv or earns a poster spot at the Capstone Symposium, even better.
